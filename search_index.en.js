is a general purpose programming language, designed to be useful for a wide range of applications, from desktop applications to embedded and distributed systems. In a first approximation Acton can be described as a seamless addition of a powerful new construct to an existing language: Acton adds actors to Python. Our take on the actor model allows developers to write highly scalable and fault tolerant code, without needing to worry about explicit state checkpointing, synchronization primitives or giving up consistency.\nActon is a compiled language, offering the speed of C but with a considerably simpler programming model. There is no explicit memory management, instead relying on garbage collection.\nActon is statically typed with an expressive type language and type inference. Type inferrence means you don't have to explicitly declare types of every variable but that the compiler will infer the type and performs its checks accordingly. We can have the benefits of type safety without the extra overhead involved in declaring types.\nThe Acton Run Time System (RTS) offers a distributed mode of operation allowing multiple computers to participate in running one logical Acton system. Actors can migrate between compute nodes and load balance the application workload. The RTS offers exactly once message delivery guarantees and strong serial state consistency without sacrificing performance. By automatically checkpointing actor states and inter-actor messages to a integrated distributed database and messaging queues, failure of individual actors or compute nodes can be transparently recovered from by the runtime system. There is no need for explicit state checkpointing or use of synchronization primitives between actors. Your system can run forever!\nState of Acton\nActon is a work in progress and still has some way to go to fully deliver on the vision. We want to sell you on the ideas and concepts that we set out to deliver, so that you may be as excited about Acton as we are :)\nRead more about the motivation behind Acton and why we thought a new language was the best avenue to achieve our goals, also covering some of the early history and learn about where we are currently at and what the future might hold.\nGetting started\nInstall\nCheck out the installation section for how to get Acton!\nLearn\nRead an introduction to using Acton in the learn Acton section.\n","id":"https://www.acton-lang.org/","title":"Acton Programming Language"},"https://www.acton-lang.org/about/":{"body":"Why does the world need Acton?\nWe believe the existence of a fault tolerant distributed programming environment with orthogonal persistence will make the world a better place. Acton was created to deliver on that belief.\nWe want a programming environment that offers persistence so that programmers do not need to spend time writing code to save program state to disk or a database (which in turn writes to disk, typically). There are few such languages in existence and even fewer, if any, in practical use. This is especially important as handling state persistence is particularly hard when writing distributed systems or working in cloud environments. The programmer should not need to spend much time dealing with state persistence.\nWe want to write small programs that can run together to form a large system. It needs to scale beyond the bounds of a single computer and we don't want the programmer to spend any extra effort to achieve this.\nWe want the system as a whole to be robust. It must tolerate failures to the hardware compute nodes used to run the system without loss of data or function. It should also help the programmer to write correct software without bugs. It's not practical to avoid bugs entirely but when we have a chance to detect and present them early, that is better than later.\nWe want a reasonably fast system. Performance is not the highest priority but one shouldn't have to needlessly buy newer or more hardware.\nWe want to lower the barrier of entry and enable people to build the robust systems that modern society needs and relies on.\nWhat makes Acton different?\nActon adopts the actor model and combines it with a simple to use syntax and a powerful type system. Many good things emanate from the combination of the actor model and a good type system.\n\nIn traditional languages, programs use shared memory to allow multiple threads or multiple processes to share state or communicate with each other. Shared memory involves locks to avoid race conditions. Checkpointing the state of a program is hard because it is hard to figure out what parts of the memory you need to checkpoint. It's all like a big hairy spaghetti ball and the safe choice is to checkpoint the entire memory of the program. This could work for small programs but we want to write large distributed programs! The key to efficiently checkpointing a program is to be able to work on smaller parts of the program and in order to do that, we need to get a grip on those smaller parts. That is hard with shared memory. There are papers on this topic with various techniques applied in attempts to realize barriers and snapshot chunks of memory but it is hard to make it work well in practice. In contrast, with actors, each actor has its own private memory which makes it possible to checkpoint the state of individual actors. Further, actors communicate with each other through messages. With our own database that implements queues inside the database, we can both read and modify database cells as well as reading, consuming or putting new items on the queues in the same transaction! This makes it possible to deal with actor checkpoints in a transactionally safe way. Many great things emanate from the actor model!\nActors do not fundamentally resolve the problem of snapshotting since it is still possible to construct a single giant actor that consumes 100GB of RAM and snapshotting that won't be fast. However, the actor model does encourage the use of many smaller actors for concurrency as well as logically splitting up your program in manageable units. In practice, it typically reduces the size and time taken to checkpoint by orders of magnitudes compared to a large traditional program. It brings persistence-through-checkpointing from theoretically feasible to practically viable.\nCheckpointing needs to happen when there are externally visible effects. The actor models makes this trivial to determine since anything that is externally visible is going to be a message to another actor. To avoid explicit state checkpointing calls, synchronization primitives or explicit IPC calls that would be forced upon the application developer, we employ magic advanced techniques in the compiler, made possible by its inherent knowledge of the language. By analyzing the code of the program we can determine suitable locations for inserting checkpointing, and this is in fact what the Acton compiler does. It splits up a program into continuations that are executed by the Acton run time system. After a continuation has been executed, its result, including the actor state, any outgoing messages to other actors as well as the consumption of the incoming message that triggered this continuation to run, is committed atomically in one transaction to the database. All this is possible thanks to the language, compiler, run time system and database working together as one. It is only possible with a new language and that is why we wrote Acton.\n\nWith Acton, an application developer simply writes single threaded Acton code and relegates the complex tasks of ensuring state consistency, persistence, fault tolerance and load balancing to the compiler, database and run time system.\nWe hope you enjoy Acton!\nNow and the road ahead\nActon is still relatively young and still has some way to go to fully deliver on the vision. Read more about the current state and outlook.\nWhat's been achieved so far?\nWe have worked on Acton for years. The first iteration of Acton was essentially a proof of concept where we used Python as the run time for the language with a heavily modified Cassandra database that featured transaction and communication queues for safely storing state. It was tied together by an early version of the Acton compiler, written in Haskell, that took Acton source code as input and produced a Python program which a standard Python interpreter could execute. It would wrap Acton actors in state preserving code that would commit the programs state to the database. This prototype was used to prove the foundational concepts.\nSince then we have implemented a new high performance run time system and a new distributed database for backend. Acton code is now compiled to C and then to machine code. The runtime system also features a new lock-free distributed database, written from scratch in C for Acton, making use of efficient optimistic concurrency transaction validation, gossip, bulk updates, integrated communication queues, and several other optimizations that make it fast. The database offers a low level C API for simple but very fast and low latency queries; suitable for building a language run time system on top of! The new run time system in turn is designed to work well together with the database.\nThe run time system works well standalone too, you don't have to use it together with the distributed database backend. You can use it to write \"normal\" programs and with native code, it is easy to make small independent programs that are easy to install since there is no need to first install an interpreter.\n","id":"https://www.acton-lang.org/about/","title":"About"},"https://www.acton-lang.org/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.acton-lang.org/blog/","title":"Posts"},"https://www.acton-lang.org/blog/2024-05-unboxing/":{"body":"Unboxing Integers\nActon's new integer unboxing feature can speed up number-heavy applications by 100x or more. In this post, we'll break down what integer unboxing is, how it works, and why it matters for your performance-critical code.\nBoxed (yellow) vs Unboxed (green) vs Python (Yellow)\n\nBoxed values\nIn many programming languages, values like integers or strings are stored in a boxed fashion. The box is a structure in memory that holds the type of the value, like \"signed 64 bit integer\", as well as the actual value, like 42. This is different than the most basic representation in computer memory, which is really just the value itself, like a series of 64 bits, without the meta-data of what type the value is of. We can think of this basic representation as \"unboxed\", there is no box to tell us what type of value is stored, it's just some stored bits. The downside of such unboxed values is that you have to keep track of the type of a value by some other means. When writing C programs, this is natural and just the way things works, like we know that variable a is of type int in the program code, so no need to also repeat that in memory but it does require the programmer to bear this burden. With higher level languages and in particular those that support generic types, it becomes necessary to keep track of value types and using boxed types is the simplest means to achieving this. Acton uses boxed values in general.\nThere's nothing wrong with boxed values, it's just that it comes with some performance overhead, so for compute intensive code, this can add up to make quite a difference. We might end up spending more time looking at the box and following pointers than doing the actual computation.\nFor a contemporary 64 bit CPU, a machine word, the normal sized chunk that the CPU deals with, is 64 bits and so any type that is 64 bits or smaller can be passed around directly. C ABI calling convention typically passes a 64 bit integer argument value to a function using a CPU register, which is incredibly fast. In contrast, a boxed value is instead sent as a pointer to the box and then the receiving function has to fetch the box and then the value from memory, which can be considerably slower.\nUnboxing boxed integers\nUnboxing is the process of removing the box around a value, allowing the value to be passed and operated on directly without any extra layers of indirection. In Acton, integers were traditionally stored as boxed values—meaning that instead of simply passing the raw number around, we were also managing metadata (such as the type of value) along with the value itself. This made certain operations, especially mathematical ones, slower than necessary.\nBy unboxing these integers, we can bypass this overhead. When an integer is unboxed, it’s stored and passed around as a raw, untagged machine word. This is similar to how a language like C would handle primitive types such as int. The result? Faster memory access and improved computational performance, especially for tight loops and arithmetic-heavy code.\nThe Acton compiler now has support for automatically detecting when an integer can be unboxed, and it will generate optimized C code accordingly. This allows you to write clean, expressive code while still benefiting from low-level performance optimizations under the hood.\nIn this first iteration, unboxing is supported for local variables and variables passed as arguments between functions. Object attributes are always boxed.\nOptimal code with unboxed integers - Discrete Cosine Transform\nThe discrete cosine transform is a very popular and widely used algorithm used for image compression. And here it is, in an Acton version:\n\nThe values operated on here are i64 and with the new support in the Acton compiler for unboxed values, the generated C code is the following:\n\nWhich is pretty much as simple and optimal as one would write by hand, bar the naming convention. In other words, using Acton, which can certainly be considered a higher level language than C, comes with essentially no overhead for this program. Boxed values are doubly bad because they also exert a massive pressure on the memory subsystem, both when allocating on the heap and when the GC subsystem is collecting garbage. This makes a tremendous difference in performance, especially for larger values where memory consumption grows. With unboxing, we avoid the extra memory allocation and instead store values on the stack and pass them to functions via CPU registers.\nDoubly good for the GC and memory subsystem\nBy not allocating memory for boxed values, we avoid the need for the garbage collector to clean up after them. This is a double win for performance, as the garbage collector can be a significant bottleneck in many applications. Acton currently uses the Boehm GC (but not for long!), which is a mark-sweep collector with a stop-the-world. All Acton Run Time System worker threads are stopped while running the GC which means that otherwise parallelizable code might not end up being very fast because we become concurrency constrained around GC. Using unboxed values avoids malloc &amp; GC altogether and so our application can easily run concurrently.\nPerformance comparison\nIn this graph we can see the performance difference between the boxed and unboxed versions of the DCT program. Depending on the input size, the unboxed version can be 100x or even faster. Python is also included in this comparison where it scores better than the boxed version but still significantly slower than the unboxed version.\nBoxed (red) vs Unboxed (green) vs Python (Yellow)\n\nIf we remove Acton's boxed version, we can zoom in on the unboxed and Python versions. Acton's unboxed version is, by quite a fair margin, consistently faster than Python, for all input sizes. The difference becomes more pronounced as the input size grows and at 10000, Acton is ~15x faster than Python.\nUnboxed (green) vs Python (yellow)\n\nMany computationally intensive applications are written in C and receive a thin wrapper in Python or some other high level language. Acton now offers an appealing alternative; writing normal Acton code is as fast as C code but remains Pythonic and simple to read and develop, while it is still possible for more specialized cases to write C code and integrate in an Acton module.\nFuture work\nThe current implementation of unboxing in Acton supports local variables and function arguments. In the future, we plan to extend this support to object and actor attributes as well. This will further improve the performance of Acton programs, especially those that rely heavily on object-oriented programming.\nFurther, monomorphization is a technique that can be used to specialize generic functions for specific types. This can be used to optimize the performance of functions that are called with a small number of different types. We plan to explore monomorphization in Acton to further improve the performance of generic functions.\nUntil then, enjoy the speed boost that unboxed integers bring to your Acton programs!\n","id":"https://www.acton-lang.org/blog/2024-05-unboxing/","title":"Unboxing Integers"},"https://www.acton-lang.org/install/":{"body":"Install\nActon is available for Linux and Mac OS X.\nThe platforms listed here are for developing with Acton.
